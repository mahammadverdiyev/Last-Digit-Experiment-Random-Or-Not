# Last Digit Experiment: Are last digits of sums and products random?


Have you ever thought if there is a pattern in the last digits when you multiply or add numbers? This project takes a look at just that!

## Whatâ€™s the Idea?

1. **Start with Numbers**: We use the numbers 0 to 9.
2. **Multiply and Find Last Digits**: We multiply each number with every other number and look only at the last digit of each result.
3. **Look for Patterns**: Once we have a grid of last digits, we can check if certain digits appear more often.

## The Questions

Are all last digits equally likely to appear when adding or multiplying random numbers? Or do some digits appear more often?

### Adding two numbers

When you add two random numbers, are all last digits (0-9) equally likely?

Example:
- \(27 + 12 = 39\), so the last digit is 9.
- \(53 + 24 = 77\), so the last digit is 7.

Does each last digit show up about the same amount?

### Multiplying two numbers

When you multiply two random numbers, is each last digit equally likely?

Example:
- \(12 \times 45 = 540\), so the last digit is 0.
- \(19 \times 68 = 1292\), so the last digit is 2.

Do all digits appear equally?

## Why bother with Last digits?

Focusing on last digits can reveal hidden patterns in math, which are useful for random number generation and understanding number properties.
